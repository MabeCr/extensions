// ARRL VHF+ contest scoring, ported from app-polo's ARRLVHFContestsExtension
// `scoringForQSO`/`accumulateScoreForOperation`/`summarizeScore` into a
// `ContestScorer`.
//
// Three scoring shapes share one scorer, selected by the running event's
// `score` kind (events.ts):
//   * `points` — a fixed value per band (Jan/Jun/Sep VHF).
//   * `distance` — `round(great-circle km) * multipliers[band]` (222 MHz+).
//   * `distanceAndPoints` — the distance formula plus `points.qso` ONCE per
//     unique callsign per band (10 GHz+, rules 5.1–5.4). The QSO points are
//     not multiplied by the band factor, and a station re-worked on the same
//     band from a new location earns distance only. Only a contact carrying
//     the event's full-length grid takes the QSO points, so an earlier
//     short-grid contact with the same station neither earns them nor uses
//     them up.
//
// `operation.grid` is the segment-effective grid for each QSO — the harness
// resolves `break`/`start` overrides before calling `scoreQso`
// (docs/design/contests.md, `ContestScorer.scoreQso` doc comment), so a
// rover's current grid is simply what this reads; no segment-walking here.
//
// A QSO worked while OUR grid differs from a prior QSO with the same station
// is not a dupe — a rover changing squares creates a new, separately-scored
// contact even against a station already worked. Only a repeat of the exact
// (call, band, our grid, their grid) tuple is a dupe. A QSO with no their-grid
// exchange never reaches the dupe check at all — it exits earlier as
// `missingExchange` and is never recorded into `worked`. A grid that is
// present but shorter than the event's exchange (`shortGrid`) still scores
// its distance: the sponsor's log checker may accept it, and refusing the
// points outright would hide a real contact behind a typing slip.
